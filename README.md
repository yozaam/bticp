# bti competitive programming

## if anyone wants to format this please go ahead ;)

[24/01, 17:29] Yohaan: Add your preferred languages for CP,
 also which platform you use ( if you don't, I recommend either HackerRank or HackerEarth or Leetcode 

Yohaan: C++, JS   -   HackerRank
[24/01, 19:46] Yohaan: Just choose any language and platform, it's all online IDE's so no problem
[12/03, 23:24] Yohaan: https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/



The applications start in few days, you can send up to five, if any get selected you'll get paid 1.5 lakhs by google

No need to have a lot of skills, find some easy projects and apply

All the best!
:)
[10/04, 15:07] Yohaan: https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/

Great resource if you're looking for something that will guide you with explanations, in whichever language you want, I'd recommend doing one program a day
[10/04, 18:16] Yohaan: They have the best peer mock interviews
[03/06, 15:46] Yohaan: hey everyone, check out https://binarysearch.io/  I'll create a room and we can all work on a coding problem together - with chat etc any language you want python js c++ -> let's start with easy and then go ahead
[03/06, 15:47] Yohaan: make an account, so that tomorrow all of us collaborate on a 15-minute problem, if you've never tried coding problems before don't worry we will start with easy problems
[10/06, 18:20] Yohaan: https://youtu.be/JMxl5rk7kGo
[11/07, 20:52] Yohaan: Definitely!

So anyone who wants to be an sde(software dev engg) at product-based companies, whether now or after ms or for the implant training needs to clear several technical rounds -> questions on data structures and algorithms 

this is the only way to get into top positions at startups/tier 1 companies(facebook amazon google etc...)



--you need to pick a programming language (c++ is best for those who want to pursue cp
-- you need to learn the data structures, arrays, linked lists, stacks,queues,trees,graphs in much more detail compared to college ds
[11/07, 20:55] Yohaan: then depending on how much time you have, you either do competitive programming on codechef/codeforces -> they have weekly contests and if you don't know anything/

 just starting out follow this google sheet -> go to the 5th/6th page called "topics wise training" and start solving -> if you cannot think of anything it in 15 minutes go read the editorial(solution)

Sheet link https://goo.gl/unDETI
[11/07, 20:56] Yohaan: this is for those who have more than a year , you don't need to learn any dataa structures etc just start the sheet, and learn when you need to
[11/07, 21:04] Yohaan: for the  others who want something more beginner friendly and focused on intereviews -> leetcode and interviewbit is the way to go

how to leetcode?
go on this page  and go according to data strutures starting at arrays-> https://leetcode.com/explore/learn/

it might be confusing but there are uncountable tutorials on youtube
( if you want recommended channels let me know) 

First you need to know the basics of a programming language for which hackerrank tracks are the best ->  https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/tutorials/30-days-of-code learn to code in 30 days/ respeective language tracks on the website https://www.hackerrank.com/dashboard

definitely choose either cpp, python or java -> js is fine if you are already very comfortable in it but not recommended since input output is very difficult

If you want an all in one course/track that explains beautifully me and my friends learnt from interviewcake( it is free with github student pack)

after one month or few weeks learning you can start practicing properly and in the start you might need to refer to solutions for everything


another good alternative that is all in one and you will get learning as well as practice resources is https://www.interviewbit.com/courses/programming/ i highly recommend it
[11/07, 21:09] Yohaan: this is extremely good and since you are not in the final year you start working on this sheet, it is for ICPC preparation and ICPC is something that will allow you to interview easily at the giants like google if you qualify
[11/07, 21:12] Yohaan: if you are looking for MLE AI Data science then you go to kaggle.com and learn and practice over there, that is a different field
[11/07, 21:28] Yohaan: https://youtu.be/shs0KM3wKv8

these are regular clg guys who cracked amazon uber directi etc
[11/07, 21:29] Yohaan: lots of stuff i know just pick one of these 3 websites and start
[11/07, 21:30] Yohaan: Btech intg LinkedIn group:

https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13858752
[11/07, 21:34] Yohaan: this is the epic subreddit where most questions are answered https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/e4v755/master_list_of_free_resources/

and here you can find lots of indians sde's working in india and usa https://www.teamblind.com/
[11/07, 21:34] Yohaan: just do this and youtube what you don't understand eg linked list mein doubt hain toh sirf woh dekho
[11/07, 21:36] Yohaan: interviewcake is best. github student link is here, give them your .nmims email id they will give LOTS of free stuff.. https://education.github.com/pack
[12/07, 14:42] Yohaan: Hey guys!

We all need projects and one of the key skills is collaboration,

 working together we can build some really major projects

We've made this group to teach everyone how open source github and git work while we add some projects to our CV,

Join it and feel free to connect with others in the group,

We are going to set up a github organisation by tomorrow morning and then start deciding on the project domains and topics, app, Web, ml we will all work together to create some amazing stuff!

We will have video workshops as well for everyone who does know how to use git github, do join and share the link with everyone in BTI 🖖

[12/07, 20:27] Yohaan: for everyone who joined yesterday, hey everyone, check out https://binarysearch.io/  I'll create a room and we can all work on a coding problem together - with chat etc any language you want python js c++ -> let's start with easy and then go ahead
make an account, so that tomorrow all of us collaborate on a 15-minute problem, if you've never tried coding problems before don't worry we will start with easy problems
[12/07, 23:08] Yohaan: if you know a language and basic array/list stuff come online
[13/07, 18:25] Yohaan: so python guys ->  about python -> practicing here is the best choice https://www.hackerrank.com/domains/python
try to get 5 stars in python you will get a badge will help you understand all basic data structure problems etc then these problems become v easy
[13/07, 18:25] Yohaan: hackerrank has cpp and other lang also  so actually all lang guys



[14/07, 16:58] Yohaan: Also we use this platform binarysearch.io to practice together, (we can all chat while solving together) it's really simple easy problems and no input output any language
[16/07, 17:06] Yohaan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SsmNI3Mlp0I 

GFG is one of the best resources if you use it properly, check these out, really high quality vids
[16/07, 17:07] Yohaan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=07QCAJYolaE nice vid for beginners where to start etx

[17/07, 12:14] Yohaan: I'll add you to a bti codeforces team
[17/07, 12:20] Yohaan: Accounts :-

https://codeforces.com/profile/yozaam
[17/07, 12:24] Yohaan: Guys, this is a valuable experience as Google codejam, Google kiskstart, acm icpc all follow the same rules, so try it out, I'm sure the first problem will be easy enough
[17/07, 18:32] Yohaan: btw -> when you friend someone on codeforces they dont get anotifiaction so just put you rname here to get added to the team
[17/07, 18:33] Yohaan: THE TEAM IS NOT NECESSARY FOR THE CONTEST, to TAKE PART IN THE CONTEST JUST CLICK ON THE CONTEST LINK AND START
[17/07, 18:35] Yohaan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWB2WfSFOUE Fantastic explanation!
[18/07, 01:11] Yohaan: Hey guys before competitive coding it's best to learn a language properly the Hackerrank tracks

 - > they are not problem solving they are for learning the language syntax properly
[22/07, 16:35] Yohaan: fantastic article -> https://luckytoilet.wordpress.com/2016/12/23/are-programming-competitions-a-good-use-of-time/ TLDR: upto 1800 rating it is very useful then not so much for interviews etc :D

https://www.programcreek.com/2012/11/top-10-algorithms-for-coding-interview/



Patterns is is great way to approach problems if you want to level up quickly
[24/07, 14:02] Yohaan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JXTVOyQpSGM advanced video but you could try similar stuff in python etc
[24/07, 15:42] Yohaan: https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-technique-to-create-an-iterative-DP-solution-from-its-recursive-solution amazing shuffle technique in anant nags answer!!! i have never seen this dp technique before
[24/07, 15:43] Yohaan: so when we do 2d table in dp, we know we can make it O ( row * col) -> O (row) by using one array but even if we use two arrays only O (2*row) is still O (row)

read anant nags ans you will get it
[24/07, 15:44] Yohaan: "We're almost done. We promised that we'll optimize the space. Notice that when we fill a row, we only need previous one row and not all previous rows. Thus we need O(r) auxiliary space and we can shuffle between current and previous rows. "

I can share just the ans lol https://qr.ae/pNskGf

[28/07, 16:30] Yohaan: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/queue-using-stacks/ last method 🙀

Should we share interesting problems from gfg/anywhere whenever one of us encounters them?
[28/07, 16:31] Yohaan: Asked in: Inmobi, Accolite, Adobe, Amazon, DE Shaw, Flipkart, Goldman Sachs, InfoEdge, MakeMyTrip, Microsoft, Oracle

Nice website, classic dp problem
[31/07, 20:41] Yohaan: https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-sorted-matrix/ fantastic problem! binary search or priority_queue solutions

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MWYFvdWje7c&t=116s easiest sol.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5wLN4UweAM also if someone understood optimised count of ≤ please tell me, i understood how to count using a binary search on each row, but not the method used in this video for counting

AND THIS crazy solution that i am struggling to understand

[01/08, 18:23] Yohaan: https://qr.ae/pNsVpB

    "You can’t make a baby in a month making nine women pregnant."
 😂what a answer
[01/08, 22:37] Yohaan: https://atcoder.jp/contests/abc174 atcoder begginer contests are the easiest
